# Weather-App
I am following a tutorial on how to make a javascript weather app using an API

Probably won't get the whole thing done today, but am hoping to use my new HTML and CSS knowledge to better understand what is happening, and hopefully learn more about javascript and APIs.

Here is the link to the Weather App:

Still new to coding so not sure if this link works for everyone.
